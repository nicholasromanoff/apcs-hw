HashMap implements a map interface, while HashSet implements a set interface.  Maps are collections that link keys to values (i.e. a->1, b->2, c->3, d->1) unlike sets, unordered collections (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4).  Both are implemented using hashes, which is what differentiates them from TreeMap and TreeSet, which also implement either Tree or Set, but using trees instead of hashes.  The sets don't allow duplicate values, and that is a major factor in determining which collection to use.  Some proper uses of representation with sets include modeling the cards comprising a poker hand, the courses making up a student's schedule, and the processes runnng on a machine.

The built in data structure resembling a heapt is called a PriorityQueue.
